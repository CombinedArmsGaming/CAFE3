# CA2 Mission Framework

A framework for creating ARMA 3 missions with as little fuss as possible.

Contains many features to help make excellent missions without the confusion.  To see what's on offer, load up this mission in the mission editor and look inside the `configuration` folder.

We're always looking for new ways to make high-quality missions easier to make.  If you have any ideas - or if you've had any trouble - please let us know on the Issues page.
