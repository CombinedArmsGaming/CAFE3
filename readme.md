# Combined Arms Framework Edition 3 (CAFE3)

A framework for creating ARMA 3 missions with as little fuss as possible. Created for and maintained by developers in the Combined Arms Milsim community.

Contains many features to help make excellent missions without the confusion.  To see what's on offer, load up this mission in the mission editor and look inside the `configuration` folder.
