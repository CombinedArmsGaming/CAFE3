---------------------------
CA_PreGearscriptCrate_Local
---------------------------

    Local event which runs just before a crate is gearscripted.  Runs local to the crate.
    Allows modification of the crate contents by altering the provided crate array.
    Prior-registered handlers may alter the contents that reach your handler.  Be aware of this while writing your handler.
    The contents can also be empty if the gearscript was not created correctly, or it was simply created empty.

    The crate array format is:
    [
        [
            "itemKind",
            [
                "ItemClassName",
                Amount (int)
            ]
        ],
        ...
    ]

    Example call site:
    ["CA_PreGearscriptCrate_Local", [_typeOfUnit, _unit, _faction, +_crateArray]] call CBA_fnc_localEvent;

    _typeOfUnit - String
        Name of crate type, eg. "crate_small" etc.
    
    _unit - Object
        The crate which will be gearscripted.

    _faction - String
        The faction that the crate contents come from.

    _crateArray - Array
        The contents which will be placed into the crate.
        This will be a copy of the original array.  This allows you to modify the contents.
        This array is passed by-reference into each handler, so gradual alterations can be performed.
        If you want to cancel the crate being gearscripted, return an empty array from the handler.


---------------------------
CA_PostGearscriptCrate_Local
---------------------------

    Identical to the CA_PreGearscriptCrate_Local event, but runs just after the crate is gearscripted.
    This event cannot be used to modify the loadout.


---------------------------
CA_PreGearscriptUnit_Local
---------------------------

    Local event which runs just before a unit is gearscripted.  Runs local to the unit.
    Allows modification of the unit's loadout by altering the provided loadout array.
    Prior-registered handlers may alter the loadout that reach your handler.  Be aware of this while writing your handler.
    The contents can also be empty if the gearscript was not created correctly, or it was simply created empty.

    This event can also be called by a unit being re-gearscripted.  In this case, the _extendedArray will always be empty.  See 'f_fnc_reapplyGear' for context.

    The loadout format is a Unit Loadout Array:
    https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Unit_Loadout_Array

    The extended array will be the CBA Extended Loadout add-on array, which will normall take the format of:
    [["key", (value)], ...]

    If there is no extended array, it will default to an empty array.  This can be used to pass info to further handlers.

    Example call site:
    ["CA_PreGearscriptUnit_Local", [_typeOfUnit, _unit, _faction, _loadout, _extendedArray]] call CBA_fnc_localEvent;

    _typeOfUnit - String
        Name of unit type, eg. "rif" etc.
    
    _unit - Object
        The unit which will be gearscripted.

    _faction - String
        The faction that the loadout came from.

    _loadout - Array
        The loadout which will be given to the unit.
        This will be a copy of the original array.  This allows you to modify the contents.
        This array is passed by-reference into each handler, so gradual alterations can be performed.
        If you want to cancel the unit being gearscripted, return an empty array from the handler.  

    _extendedArray - Array
        The extended-info array from a CBA Extended Loadout.
        This array can contain arbitrary info, but it generally looks like the example above.
        This array is passed by-reference into each handler, so gradual alterations can be performed.


---------------------------
CA_PostGearscriptUnit_Local
---------------------------

    Identical to the CA_PreGearscriptUnit_Local event, but runs just after the unit is gearscripted.
    This event cannot be used to modify the loadout.
