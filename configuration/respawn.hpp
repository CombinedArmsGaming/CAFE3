    Respawn configuration.

    RESPAWN MODES:
        Set a respawn mode for each side.  They can be one of the following:

        RESPAWN_MODE_TICKETS                 - Ticket-based respawn, from whatever tickets have been configured.
        RESPAWN_MODE_TIMED                   - A respawn timer for each player individually.
        RESPAWN_MODE_TIMED_TICKETS           - Like RESPAWN_MODE_TIMED but with tickets also.
        RESPAWN_MODE_TIMED_WAVES             - A respawn timer for wave respawns.  Players will respawn at the same time at the configured interval.
        RESPAWN_MODE_TIMED_WAVES_TICKETS     - Like RESPAWN_MODE_TIMED_WAVES but with tickets also.
        RESPAWN_MODE_TRIGGERED_WAVES    	 - The classic wave system, triggered by any group leader.
        RESPAWN_MODE_TRIGGERED_WAVES_TICKETS - Like RESPAWN_MODE_TRIGGERED_WAVES, but with tickets also.

    The RESPAWN_DELAY for each side affects the modes above.  They set wave delay, individual respawn delay etc.

    Tickets can be given to each side, and also to players of each side.  When a player respawns, they will use their own personal tickets first before using any side tickets.

    Respawn locations can be created in the editor using the vanilla respawn system.  To affect when a respawn location is enabled/disabled, connect it to a trigger.
    Examples are placed in the default mission file.
