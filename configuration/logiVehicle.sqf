    Logistics vehicle configuration
    Inspired by F3_CA's logi vic system.  Initial work by Joecuronium, expanded by Bubbus.

    This file allows you to configure logistics vehicles for your mission.
    Logistics vehicles can be used to spawn-in new assets for your players.  It may be operated by anyone in a certain group, or anyone of a certain role.

    Multiple kinds of logistics vehicle may be configured here.  In the editor, assign the logistics role to a vehicle by using the following line in the 'Init' box:

        [this, "example"] call f_fnc_setLogiVehicle;
