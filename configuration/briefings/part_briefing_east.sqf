// SIDE: EAST

//Creating simple tasks.
//Previous examples for task creation were needlessly complicated, they don't need to be. Whilst the completion of one is handled by 
//triggers in game, it can sometimes be enough to just have them be present on a players journal, it directs them, and keeps players on task.

//It is good practice to create them in the sides briefing file, as this means it seperates them neatly, without the creation of further files.

//Tasks follow this style:

//[civilian,["task1"],["Do this and you get a cookie","Earn Cookie","cookiemarker"],[0,0,0],1,2,true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate
//[east,["task2"],["Good luck finding this cookie","Find Cookie","cookiemarker2"],objNull,1,3,true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate //Task without a map location

//However, we don't use the civilian or east terms, as this is the eastern briefing file, instead, we can do something like this:

//[group player, "AANorth", ["Destroy the AA present in Northern Aliabad", "Destroy the AA", "AANorth"], "AANorth", true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate;
//[group player, "AASouth", ["Destroy the AA present in Southern Aliabad", "Destroy the AA", "AASouth"], "AASouth", true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate;

//The two above would create two tasks for the Opfor team, it would create tasks for any player who also has this file directed at them, this is why 
//it is better to handle tasks in the side's relevant briefing file. For the completion of tasks, refer to the trigger present on the framework's mission.sqm 
//in game.
