/*
    ACRE2 Settings File

    Use this file to set up a radio net for your mission.  All sides can be configured differently, and all ACRE radios can be used.

    RADIO NAMES REFERENCE:

        The following radios will be added to the unit's vest or uniform:
            "ACRE_PRC343", "ACRE_PRC152", "ACRE_PRC148", "ACRE_BF888S", "ACRE_SEM52SL"
        
        The following radios will be added to the unit's backpack (if the unit has no backpack, one will be given):
            "ACRE_PRC117F", "ACRE_PRC77", "ACRE_SEM70"

    RADIO COMMAND ARGUMENTS REFERENCE:

        _radio - String
            Name of the radio to give to the units.  This is the class-name of the radio.  For examples, see 'components\radio\acre\globals.sqf'.
        
        _channelName - String
            Name of the channel the radio should be tuned to.  If the channel doesn't exist already, it is generated automatically for you.
        
        _side - Side
            The side which this configuration applies to.  Multiple sides per command are not supported.
            
        _groupName - String OR Array of Strings
            The name of the group that this configuration applies to.  If multiple group names are provided, the configuration applies to all of them.

        _role - String OR Array of Strings
            The Gearscript role-name that this configuration applies to.  If multiple role names are provided, the configuration applies to all of them.

    RADIO COMMAND REFERENCE:

        Summary:
            f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllUnits
            f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInGroup
            f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInRole
            f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToRoleInGroup
            f_fnc_acre_removeRadioFromAllInRole
            f_fnc_acre_removeRadioFromAllInGroup
            f_fnc_acre_removeRadioFromRoleInGroup

        These commands can be used in any order - the proper behaviour is figured out by the framework.

        f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllUnits
            Gives a radio tuned to the given channel to every unit on the given side.
            Args:
                ["_radio", "_channelName", "_side"]
            Example:
                // Gives a Baofeng radio to all BLUFOR, tuned to the "ALL BLUFOR" net.
                ["ACRE_BF888S", "ALL BLUFOR", west] call f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllUnits;

        f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInGroup
            Gives a radio to every unit in the given group and side.
            Args:
                ["_radio", "_channelName", "_side", "_groupName"]
            Example:
                // Gives a short-range radio to all members of BLUFOR ALPHA, tuned to "ALPHA SR" net.
                ["ACRE_PRC343", "ALPHA SR", west, "ALPHA"] call f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInGroup;

            Args:
                ["_radio", "_channelName", "_side", "_role"]
            Example:
                // Gives a SEM-52 long-range radio to all BLUFOR SLs, FTLs, Medics and the CO, tuned to "GROUND CMD".
                ["ACRE_SEM52SL", "GROUND CMD", west, ["sl", "ftl", "co", "med"]] call f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInRole;

        f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToRoleInGroup
            Gives a radio to specific role(s) in specific group(s).
            Args:
                ["_radio", "_channelName", "_side", "_role", "_groupName"];

                ["ACRE_PRC343", "COOL NET", west, "rif", "SPECOPS"] call f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInGroup;

        f_fnc_acre_removeRadioFromAllInRole
            Takes away a radio from every unit with the given role on the given side.
            Useful when 'f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllUnits' has been used, but there's one exception that should not have the radio.
            Args:
                ["_radio", "_channelName", "_side", "_role"]
            Example:
                // Removes a SEM-52 long-range radio from all BLUFOR FTLs, which was tuned to "GROUND CMD".
                ["ACRE_SEM52SL", "GROUND CMD", west, "ftl"] call f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInRole;

        f_fnc_acre_removeRadioFromAllInGroup
            Takes away a radio from every unit in the given group and side.

        f_fnc_acre_removeRadioFromRoleInGroup
            Takes away a radio from specific role(s) in specific group(s).
            Useful when 'f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInGroup' or 'f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInRole' has been used, but there's one exception that should not have the radio.
            Args:
                ["_radio", "_channelName", "_side", "_role", "_groupName"];
            Example:
                // Removes a short-range radio from an extremely suspicious individual in the BLUFOR ALPHA group, which was tuned to "ALPHA SR" net.
                ["ACRE_PRC343", "ALPHA SR", west, "sus", "ALPHA"] call f_fnc_acre_giveRadioToAllInGroup;
