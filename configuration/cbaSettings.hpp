	Description:
		This file allows you to enable different addon settings. Be sure to only enable one per category.
		This system is only for the sake of convenience and does not replace checking the ingame addon settings, which the framework relies on.
		If all settings of a category are disabled, you can set those settings manually in the ingame addon menu.
