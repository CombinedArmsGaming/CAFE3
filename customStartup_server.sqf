// Use this file to run code when the mission starts.

// This file runs server-side, so code here will run only once.  This is the best file to use for weather commands, triggering mission events, etc.

// This code is 'scheduled', which means you can use 'sleep', 'uiSleep', 'waitUntil' etc for code timing.
// This code will run immediately - it won't wait until the map-screen ends.  If you need it to wait, use this at the start: waitUntil {time > 0}
// If you need this code to finish running before the 'configuration' folder begins running, look inside the 'init.sqf' file for instructions.
